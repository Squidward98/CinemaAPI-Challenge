## CHALLENGE CINEMA API REST.

This is a Rest API for cinemas!

=============================================================================

### The API must comply with the following instructions:

1) Create a system for buying movie tickets.

2) The system will manage 2 types of user roles:

    - Common user: is able to see all the movies and theaters in the
that are available and buy a certain amount of tickets for
a function.

    - User admin: in addition to see the list of cinemas and movies that have
function in each one, is able to add and edit the information of these.

3) Both users must have the basic and necessary information: name,
surname, email, address, telephone (optional: profile image).

4) At the time of purchase, you must persist: the user who made it,
the film to be screened, in which cinema, and the schedule.

5) The system must use JWT for the authentication of the users.

EXTRA:
Consider that the cinema could have more than one movie theater (where
they will screen the films) with different capacities, keep that in mind at the time of purchase.
